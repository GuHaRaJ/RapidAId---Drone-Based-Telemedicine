# RapidAid---Drone-Based-Telemedicine

**Status:** Under Development

RapidAid aims to revolutionize healthcare access by providing rapid, on-demand delivery of medicines via drones. This repository contains the frontend component of the RapidAid system.

## Project Overview

RapidAid addresses the critical need for timely access to essential medicines, especially in remote or underserved areas. By leveraging drone technology, we aim to:

*   **Reduce delivery times:** Significantly faster delivery compared to traditional methods.
*   **Expand access to care:** Reach patients in areas with limited infrastructure or transportation options.
*   **Improve emergency response:** Deliver critical medications quickly during emergencies.

This frontend application allows users to:

*   Browse available medications.
*   Place orders for drone delivery.
*   Track the delivery status in real-time.
*   Manage their medical profiles.

## Current Stage

This project is currently in the development phase. The frontend is actively being built and refined. Key features are still under implementation and may be subject to change.

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **Backend (for integration):** Flask (Python)



## Future Plans

*   Implement user authentication and authorization.
*   Integrate with the backend Flask API.
*   Develop real-time drone tracking functionality.
*   Improve web design based on user feedback.
